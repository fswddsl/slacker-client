    <p><sp id="user-description">Diegoâ€™s preference is to deal with the back-end of web application development, because of his greater interest in business logic processes and database applications. However, he also needs to be able to understand the front-end that deals with the user needs and how best they can interface with the application. A full-stack web development approach would allow him to work on both ends while progressively developing more experience and focus on the back-end. <Br><Br> Diego has limited experience coding, though he picked up some insight back in the days when fortran and pascal were used. He has also worked with programmers on database applications in the past. More recently he interacted with web developers on static web content.<br><br></sp></p>
